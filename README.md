Note:
* We have detailed EDA and 2 different approaches for modeling and prediction
* DBDA2E-utilities.r is our source file for approach 1.r
* Also Put the HDIofMCMC.R and plotPost.R in the same path to get the plot correctly (for approach 2.r).
* Just run the Final Project Team 2 - Approach 1.r and Final Project Team 2 - approach 2.r to get the code working
